# Purpose

This small application is utilized to help transfer visitor sign ins from Firebase to Supabase.

## Why move?

Firebase is a great service for Auth, Storage, and overall data collection, however due to price and other ongoing projects like the <a href="https://github.com/andrewbarker96/stockassoc-contact-app">"Contact Application"</a> I am currently building for my company. It was determined that it would be better to house all services under Supabase to save costs, and allow Auth & Storage for multiple apps under one roof. Until the solution is finalized and original <a href="https://github.com/andrewbarker96/sign-in-app">Sign In Application</a> can be updated. This script will allow for easy transfer of data as new entries get added into Firebase.
